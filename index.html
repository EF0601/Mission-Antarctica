            <h1>Resources</h1>
            <p>Antarctica is a hard place to survive in. As head of your expedition team, you must make the decision of
                how much food to bring. There are three presets:
            <ol>
                <li>2000 units of rations (Easy mode, should have lots to spare at the end. However the score will have
                    a multiplier of 0.9)</li>
                <li>1250 units of rations (Normal mode, provides more of a challenge, and you might have to buy more at
                    camps. Score multiplier of 1.)</li>
                <li>750 units of rations (Hard mode, budget wisely. You definitely have to buy more at camps, or ration
                    very well. Score multiplier of 1.3)</li>
            </ol><br>
            </p>
